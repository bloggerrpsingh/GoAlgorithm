**Bloom Filter**

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not – in other words, a query returns either “possibly in set” or “definitely not in set“. Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with a “counting” filter); the more elements that are added to the set, the larger the probability of false positives.
